# Hello thereâ€¦
We're looking for a contract designer to come and help us at [audioBDoom](http://audioboom.com). We are reshaping on-demand radio and there's a lot of work to do, for 3-6 months at least.

We have millions of users and millions of audio posts from user-generated content and from podcasts, news, comedy and radio channels like the BBC, Xfm, Sky Sports. We even have a team of journalists making our own news content as it happens.

## The problem:
We have great content, in fact our content is amazing - but it's not being heard. We need to make it available and accessible in better ways and are doing a huge amount of work improving our website and mobile apps.

## Job overview
You'll be solving problems on the web and with native apps. We're looking for somebody to prototype and validate ideas quickly, identify problems that need to be solved and work with data, users and stakeholders to continuously iterate on and improve our products.

Our audio content is available to all on the web and accessibility is very important to us.

We're not looking for remote workers. We need somebody on-site who can draw on the wall and participate in and conduct workshops with the team.

## Who we are looking for
We're looking for a product designer with visual and user experience design skills.

Your ideal experience would include working with most of the following:

* Accessibility
* Personas
* Style guides
* Pattern libraries
* Responsive design
* iOS design
* Android design
* Rapid prototyping
* User testing

We're looking for somebody who is not hung up on specific wireframing tools and happy to adapt.

## Where are we?
Our offices are based in [Maltings Place, Tower Bridge Road](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Maltings+Place,+Tower+Bridge+Rd,+London+SE1+3JB/@51.500511,-0.078954,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x4876034460978ea7:0x5a9857ac6c37daf0) - when you apply we'll give you full details.

## Interested?

We're ready for you to start immediately if you can and look forward to meeting you!
